                    Such circumstances are termed as “Open Title” situation. The company would require
                    the proof of title / succession certificate issued by the competent court. The claim
                    would be paid to the person specified in the said proof and our liability as an
                    insurer will be discharged. If the company has accepted the claim but is waiting
                    for such proof, then the company holds the money till the proof is submitted and
                    pays the interest as directed by the IRDA from time to time.

                    claim will have to be paid within 30 days from the date of receipt of all claim
                    documents. In case the claim warrants an investigation, then the insurance company
                    has to complete the investigation not later than 6 months from the time of making
                    the claim. Moreover, if a claim is ready for payment but the payment cannot be made
                    because of conflicts or insufficiency of proof of title, then the insurer may apply
                    to pay the amount into the Court, or, such an amount will earn interest at the prevalent
                    rate applicable to a savings bank account.
